This is my configuration for the Notion window manager.

Compared to Notion 4's default config, this config is oriented more closely
towards Notion 3's keybindings. Mostly I need a quick way to install "my"
notion on any Linux/*NIX machine I come across. I try to include related files
in this repository to give a more complete picture of my setup in the hope that
it will be helpful. So far, these are:

 * inputplug.sh: detects laptop docking station dock/undock events by detecting
   whether a keyboard is being plugged in because I have yet to find another
   way to detect these events reliably. On docking, keyboard.sh and xrandr.sh
   are run.

 * keyboard.sh: (re)sets my keyboard layout, plain and simple

 * xinitrc: ~/.xinitrc on my system is a symlink to this file

 * xrandr.sh: takes one parameter (on or off) and configures the screens like
   on my home setup
